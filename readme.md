YouTube Shuffle
This is a toy-project to help you rediscover your YouTube subscriptions. Live demo:



Once you sign-in with a Google account, you will get a random list of videos from your existing subscriptions. There's no algorithm or data-collection, every time you get a new unique page of random goodies

The source code was designed to help you get started with YouTube JavaScript API's, including OAuth2 sign-in, channels, playlists and subscribtions. It also showcases basic use of bootstrap, FontAwesome and Google Fonts

The code is public domain
